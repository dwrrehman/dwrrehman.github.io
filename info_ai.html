<h1>This is an Artificial Intelligence created by Daniel Rehman.</h1><hr>

<h1>What is its purpose?</h1>

<p>Its purpose is to interact with humans
in the languages <i><b>fubau</b></i> and <i><b>Javascript</b></i> in a human-like way. <br></p>

<h1>How do you use it?</h1>

<p>There are four main input types you can say to it:</p>
<p class="list">
	- <b>Human language</b><br>
	- <b>Computer language</b><br>
	- <b>Commands</b><br>
	- <b>Shortcuts</b><br></p>

<h2>Human language:</h2>
	<p>This type of input should be said completely in the langauge of <i>fubau</i>, but can be extremely freeform.
		all spaces are removed, as well as numerals, special characters, (except for periods)
		and all letters are converted to lowercase. also, any stray consonants are removed from the input if they do not contribute to a word,
		which resolves most typos.
		a dictionary and tutorial is available if you need help speaking the language intelligeablely.</p>

<h2>Computer language:</h2>
	<p>This artifical intelligence has the unique capability of speaking two very different languages.
		the AI also knows the computer programming language <i>Javascript</i>,
		so any ad-hoc coding you wish to do can be executed in the input stream, simply by entering <i>Javascript</i> mode.
		to enter JS mode, you can either press "j" and then enter, or type the command "//" and then enter.
		these both put you into JS mode for you to type any amount of vaild javascript into the textarea.
		to execute the code and return to <i>fubau</i> mode, you simply must type "//", just as you may have went into JS mode.
		because of this architecure, JS single-line comments are prohibited.
		other than this, every <i>Javascript</i> functionality should be built into the AI. </p>

<h2>Commands:</h2>
	<p>Built into this artificial intelligence are a list of commands that execute various functionalities that might be of use. here is the list of possible commands:</p>
	<p>
		- <b>/</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an empty command, or some special functionality.<br>
		- <b>// </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enter Javascipt mode.(must be root)<br>
		- <b>/.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an initiation command.<br>
		- <b>/login</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;login to the user database.<br>
  		- <b>/clear</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clear the screen, but keep the conversation in memory.<br>
		- <b>/add</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;add an entry to the dictionary, or some other domain.(must be root)<br>
  		- <b>/kill</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kill the artifical intelligence by closing the window.(must be root)<br>
		- <b>/display conversation</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; display the current conversation.<br>
  		- <b>/display dictionary</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; display every word in the dictionary.<br>
		- <b>/display predicates</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; display all the legal predicates.<br>
  		- <b>/display previous commands</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; display the commands you've typed.<br>
		- <b>/display max word length</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;display the lexer's maximum length of a word it will accept. (default is 3).<br>
  		- <b>/new</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open this artifical intelligence again in a new window.<br>
		- <b>/test</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a test statement used for debugging.<br>
		- <b>/who am i</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;display the user who's logged in at the moment.<br>
		- <b>/reset</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reset the artifical intelligence by reloading the web page.<br>
  		- <b>/info</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open this info page.<br>
		- <b>/list</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; display a list of these commands.<br>
  		- <b>/set max word length</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; change the lexer's maximum length of a word it will accept. (must be root)<br>
		- <b>/break</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; effectively break the artifical intelligence by deleteing all the html. (must be root)<br>
		- <b>/hide</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hide the user interface until a key is pressed.<br>

<h2>Shortcuts:</h2>
<p>These are a small list of single letter commands which are generally used so much they were warrented a shortcut to them,
	as opposed to typing out the whole command every time. the shortcuts are as follows:</p>
<p class="list">
	- <b>u</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; signify the end of transmission, and close the AI.<br>
	- <b>x</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kill the AI by force closing it.<br>
	- <b>h</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hide the user interface until a key is pressed. <br>
	- <b>j</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enter Javascript mode.<br>
	- <b>r</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reset the AI by reloading the web page. <br>
	- <b>c</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear the screen but keep the conversation. <br>
	- <b>d</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; display the current conversation so far. <br>
	- <b>l</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; list the possible commands you can tell it.<br>
</p>

<h1>What is it comprised of?</h1>

<p>The artificial intelligence and everything it entails is composed of 3 main sections with subsections:<br><br></p>
<p class="list">
	- <b>Checker</b><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Executer <br>
	- <b>Parser</b><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Lexer<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Labeler<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Other grammar functions<br>
	- <b>Responder</b><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Semantic database<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Neural network<br><br></p>

<h2>Checker:</h2>
<p>this function gets the users input before any other function, 
and is a series of if-statements which check to see if the input is one of a few special commands.
these commands are mainly command-line interface functions, like clearing the screen, printing the current conversation, and closing the window. 
there is also a spot to where a user defined functionality can lie.</p><br>

<h2>Checker:Executer:</h2>
<p>this function is a series of if-statements that some time implement a similar functionality as the checker, 
but other times has unique capabilities which make it important. it works by checking if the input has a forward slash at the beginning of the string. 
if it does, this means it is a non-linguistic command to be executed. 
after it knows it is a command, it runs through some if statements and checks each possible command. </p><br>

<h2>Parser:</h2>
<p>this is functions job is primarily to understand the language of choice for this artificial intelligence, which is <i>fubau</i>.<i>fubau</i> is made to be completely unambiguous,  as to make the parser much simpler.
the two major things the parser has to accomplish are <b>lexing</b> the input, 
so identifying all strings in the input that are also contained within the dictionary, 
and <b>labeling</b> the input, which consists of identifying all grammtical constructs 
and labeling it with the name of that respective construct in the form of an object. 
this sets the input up for the responder to interpret it and make a response.
