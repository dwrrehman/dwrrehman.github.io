  manual for f ("file", or "folder")
_____________________________________


usage:

	f [filename]

inputs: 

	accepts an optional parameter which is the name of the 
	file to be inspected.

	if the filename parameter is not given, the directory filename 
	"." is used instead. this directory name always refers to the 
	current directory, similar to unix systems.

	".." always refers to the directory containing the current directory, 
	also similar to unix systems.

output: 

	prints the directory listing, or file contents. 
	
	if the filename refers to a directory, the filenames/direcotry names 
	within that directory will be displayed in sequence, 
	similar to the unix command "ls".

	if the filename refers to just a regular file, the contents of the file 
	will be printed to the terminal, if possible, for the given file type.	

examples: 

	:: f                    (lists the files in the current directory)
	:: f . 			(same as above)
	:: f file.txt           (prints the file.txt contents to the terminal)
	:: f home/my_folder     (prints a list of files and directories that are in the folder)
	:: f ..                 (prints a list of files and directories that are in the parent folder)

notes:

	sync. ajax get requests are used to get the manuals for the commands.
