			Hey, this is my first blog post!

			I'm trying this blog thing out, because for a while ive already been writing my thoughts down in text documents, and i figured that many of them are probably interesting to a select few people out there, so i figured because i have this website and everything that im not really doing much with, why not make a blog? we will see how it goes.

			for the curious, I actually wrote a program (which i call "./blogify") to do most of the work for me: it takes a text document that i wrote, with the date on the first line, encoded in my own personal datetime format, and converts it into a html document which looks like this. Im still working on the formatting, so it will probably change alittle bit, but for the most part, I want to keep this whole system very foolproof, minimalist, simple, etc. 

			Something you should probably know about me, is that im terrible at writing in english. typos, spelling mistakes, and worst of all, (sometimes purposeful) grammatical mistakes are copious in my writing, and if that bothers you, i might reccomend reading another blog. for the people more interested in the content of what i am saying rather than the way i say it, sit back and enjoy the river of thoughts flowing from my finger tips on this sunday night.

			My interests range from a vareity of items, including physics, computer science, music, art, (and as of recently, poetry) and some more that i cant think of right now, because im bad as listing things, and i will most likely be talking about these are much more abstract things related to them, because thats generally the variety of thoughts that i parttake in, mostly. things you probably will tend to NOT find on this blog include my external sensory pertaining life, anythign mundane (or deemed as such, by be) like work or school, or monetary things. no relationship stuff, (at least, from what i can foresee), but probably some deep talks about how i feel about things, just because i like giving my most internal thoughts on the matter sometimes.

			anyways, enough foreplay. gunna be totally honest, this particular blogpost was mainly just meant as a introduction to this blog, and maybe also as a way for me to test my code. :P thanks for tunning in, and i hope you like the future (hopefully more substantive) stuff i have to say on this thing.
