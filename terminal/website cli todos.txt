CLI for our website TODOs:

- add an actual C compiler that we ewill write ourselves.
- implement simple syntax highlighting for javscrpit
- make it more pretty 
- set it as the home page for the website
- allow us to load webpages, that are also on the website, if we need to.
- add more documents about us, and our resume and stuff, to the file system (add some of our other js code on to the website.)
- redo the interpreter for commands (recog) (make it uniform and extensible)
- allow the use to add a command by adding it to /bin/
- allow the user to find a file on the system by calling open("/full/filepath/");
- allow the user to write javascript, or write HTML code?


- allow the user to print different colored text.

- allow the user to move the cursor, do line returns, clear the screen, and do other "c" - "tty" commands.













other: future todos:


think about writing a server application, which our website would talk to, and the server application needs a validation request, to know its me, and then allows the user to push the state of the filesystem to the server, to save it.
it would just be a file save, where the file is the json string.


if... we can get our connection.cpp code working.   because the server would be written in cpp.
